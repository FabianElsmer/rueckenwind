r√ºckenwind
==========

A python web framework based on tornado, jinja2, babel.


Documentation
=============

Head over to `Read The Docs <http://ruckenwind.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ and read the docs! Or build the docs from source using: ``sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs.html/`` and enjoy locally.

Current State
=============

The framework does not yet provide a stable API.  When the API stabalizes the version is incremented to 1.x.  If used for anything that is remotely production-use make sure you stay within one 0.x branch of releases.  The current API (0.5.x / master) is not backward compatible to 0.4.x releases. The 0.4 branch is a major overhaul and is incompatible with 0.3.
